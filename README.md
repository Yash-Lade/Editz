# Editz

Editz is an AI-driven, prompt-based video editing plugin for web applications. It transforms your cursor into an intelligent editing tool: hover over your timeline or preview, type or speak simple English commands—like “trim intro,” “add title,” or “remove background noise”—and see your edits applied instantly.

🚀 Features

Prompt-Driven Editing: Use natural language to perform trims, color grades, audio adjustments, transitions, captions, and more.

Cursor-First UI: Hover over any clip or frame to reveal edit badges—no digging through menus.

Instant Preview: On-device AI (ffmpeg-wasm & TensorFlow.js) provides real-time feedback.

Cloud Rendering: Serverless ffmpeg powers final HD renders, queued and delivered asynchronously.

Prompt History & Undo/Redo: Track all your commands, replay edits, and revert changes seamlessly.

Cross-Platform Plugin: Drop into any web-based editor (Clipchamp, Veed.io, Kapwing) with a single JS script.
